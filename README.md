# Concurrency in Golang

## Overview

### What is CSP
CSP stands for "Conmmunicating Sequential Processes"

## Libraries
### Sync
Package sync provides basic syncronization primitives such as mutual exclusion locks. Other than the Once and WaitGroup types, most are intended for use by low-level library routines. Higher-level synchronization is better done via channels and communication.
